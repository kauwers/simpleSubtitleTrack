# simpleSubtitleTrack

README

This Python 3 script converts legacy Quicktime text tracks to SRT format.
Before running, please convert text tracks to UTF-8, using TextWrangler (http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ ) or another text editor.

You will need Python3 to run (https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/)

To run:
1.
Place all text tracks in the “simpleSubtitleTrack/text_tracks” folder.

2.
In Mac OS X Terminal, set the current directory to “simpleSubtitleTrack”.  

Example:
cd /Users/yourname/Desktop/simpleSubtitleTrack

3.
Run the script in Mac OS X Terminal:

python convertToSRT.py
Or
python3 convertToSRT.py

(Depending on your installation)

A folder “simpleSubtitleTrack/srt” should appear with your converted text tracks.
